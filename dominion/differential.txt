Assignment 4 - 3

The differences between the two games begin manifesting themselves as differences between the cards in the players hands.
This is seen in the first instance where the player does not have a village-smithy combination -- they only have the smithy component. 
These changes in available actions then change the number of coins available, changing what is subsequently purchased. 
Thus, the differences in the each version of the game continues to grow from this point.

The line number where the difference occurred can be used to calculate when in the execution of the program the difference occurred.
With this, we can examine the state of the game directly prior to this spot to hopefully see what internal difference caused the difference.
Pinpointing the bug that caused the difference in the drawn hand with only the play-by-play output of the game is difficult, because it only lets us know what actions were taken.
To truly know why these actions resulted in an error we need to know not just what action was taken, but what environment the action was taken in.

The length of the difference file also provides insight into the level of difference between the two game runs.

for the code coverage result, my test ended up with 80% test coverage when my classmate got 60%. This show that my test has a better code coverage and that help to decide who code is correct.
